    <p>Hey there! I'm <strong class="name">Ammar Mohammed Saber (<span class="alias">xLe0x</span>)</strong>, a <span class="highlight">junior pentester</span> and <span class="highlight">CTF enthusiast</span> with a passion for breaking things (in a good way!). My journey in ethical hacking started with a curiosity that’s only grown stronger as I’ve delved deeper into the world of cybersecurity.</p>

    <p>Whether it's hunting bugs, solving CTF challenges, or mastering new tools, I’m constantly learning and pushing my limits. Each challenge is an opportunity to sharpen my skills and get one step closer to mastering this ever-evolving field.</p>

    <p>Cybersecurity is my playground, and I'm just getting started. If you're as passionate about hacking, learning, and growing as I am, let’s connect and continue exploring what's possible!</p>
